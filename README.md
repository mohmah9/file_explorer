# chat(new!)
There is a new button for chating.When you click on the chat button the file manager asks if you want to make a chat server if you say yes ,a server will be created on localhost and a client as your computer connects to it.

When another computer wants to connect to this server it should press the chat button and when it asks to create a server ,select no ,then you should input the server ip address(you can use ipconfig command).Now you are connected to the chatroom and you have to write your name,then you can chat with other clients. :)

# FTP(new!)
For accessing to another computer files,we provided an FTP button.As you click it you will be asked if you want to make a server.when you say yes a server will be created on localhost and it waits for another computer to connect.

On the Other computer you should click FTP button but select no ,so it asks you to input server ip address(you can use ipconfig command).After entering the ip address you should press OK on the server computer.Now you can see the client files and folders and surf thorough them.

You can also copy and remove files on client computer by the server computer.Also you can select a file and click on the download button to download it on your computer. :)
